2.21.0 / 2020-01-25
==================

This is a massive release!

## Highlights

You can now hit Ctrl-C during a long reload in bash and zsh and it will not
loop anymore.

Commands that use `direnv_load` won't fail when there is an output to stdout
anymore (eg: `use_nix`).

Direnv now also loads files from `.config/direnv/lib/*.sh`. This is intended
to be used by third-party tools to augment direnv with their own stdlib
functions.

The `.envrc` is now loaded with `set -euo pipefail`. This will more likely
expose issues with existing `.envrc` files.

## docs

  * Update README.md (#536)
  * Add link to asdf-direnv. (#535)

  * warn if PS1 is being exported
  * handle SIGINT during export in bash
  * export: display the full RC path instead of a relative one
  * direnv exec: the DIR argument is always required (#493)

## build

  * staticcheck (#543)
  * use go modules
  * make: handle when /dev/stderr doesn't exist (#491)
  * site: use jekyll to render the website
  * Pin nixpkgs to current NixOS 19.09 channel (#526)

## shells

  * fix elvish hook
  * Use `fish_preexec` hook instead of `fish_prompt` (#512)
  * Use `fish_postexec` to make sure direnv hook executed 'after' the directory has changed when using `cd`.
  * improve zsh hook (#514)

## config.toml
