==================================================

NAME
----

direnv_stdlib - the ".envrc" stdlib

SYNOPSIS
--------

`direnv stdlib`

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Outputs a bash script called the *stdlib*. The following commands are included in that script and loaded in the context of an ".envrc". Additionnaly to that, it also loads the file in "~/.direnvrc" if it exists.

STDLIB
------

* `has` *command*:
    Returns 0 if the *command* is available. Returns 1 otherwise. It can be a binary in the PATH or a shell function.

Example:

    if has curl; then
      echo "Yes we do"
    fi

* `expand_path` *rel_path* [*relative_to*]:
    Outputs the absolute path of *rel_path* relative to *relative_to* or the current directory.

Example:

    cd /usr/local/games
    expand_path ../foo
    # output: /usr/local/foo

* `dotenv` [*dotenv_path*]:
    Loads a ".env" file into the current environment

* `user_rel_path` *abs_path*:
    Transforms an absolute path *abs_path* into a user-relative path if possible.

Example:

    echo $HOME
    # output: /home/user
    user_rel_path /home/user/my/project
    # output: ~/my/project
    user_rel_path /usr/local/lib
    # output: /usr/local/lib

* `find_up` *filename*:
    Outputs the path of *filename* when searched from the current directory up to /. Returns 1 if the file has not been found.

Example:

    cd /usr/local/my
    mkdir -p project/foo
    touch bar
    cd project/foo
    find_up bar
    # output: /usr/local/my/bar

* `source_env` *file_or_dir_path*:
    Loads another ".envrc" either by specifying its path or filename.

* `source_up` [*filename*]:
    Loads another ".envrc" if found with the `find_up` command.

* `direnv_load` [*command-generating-dump-output*]
    Applies the environment generated by running *argv* as a
    command. This is useful for adopting the environment of a child
    process - cause that process to run "direnv dump" and then wrap
    the results with direnv_load.

Example:

    direnv_load opam-env exec -- direnv dump

* `PATH_add` *path*:
    Prepends the expanded *path* to the PATH environment variable. It prevents a common mistake where PATH is replaced by only the new *path*.

Example:

    pwd
    # output: /home/user/my/project
    PATH_add bin
    echo $PATH
    # output: /home/user/my/project/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

* `path_add` *varname* *path*:
    Works like `PATH_add` except that it's for an arbitrary *varname*.

* `load_prefix` *prefix_path*:
    Expands some common path variables for the given *prefix_path* prefix. This is useful if you installed something in the *prefix_path* using
    `./configure --prefix=$prefix_path && make install` and want to use it in
    the project.

Variables set:

    CPATH
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    LIBRARY_PATH
    MANPATH
    PATH
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH

Example:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/rubies/ruby-1.9.3
    make && make install
    # Then in the .envrc
    load_prefix ~/rubies/ruby-1.9.3

* `layout` *type*:
    A semantic dispatch used to describe common project layouts.

* `layout go`:
    Sets the GOPATH environment variable to the current directory.

* `layout node`:
    Adds "$PWD/node_modules/.bin" to the PATH environment variable.

* `layout perl`:
    Setup environment variables required by perl's local::lib
    See http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/lib/local/lib.pm for more
    details

* `layout python` [*python_exe*]:
    Creates and loads a virtualenv environment under `$PWD/.direnv/virtualenv`. This forces the installation of any egg into the project's sub-folder.

    It's possible to specify the python executable if you want to use different versions of python (eg: `layout python python3`).

* `layout ruby`:
    Sets the GEM_HOME environment variable to `$PWD/.direnv/ruby/RUBY_VERSION`. This forces the installation of any gems into the project's sub-folder.
    If you're using bundler it will create wrapper programs that can be invoked directly instead of using the `bundle exec` prefix.

* `use` *program_name* [*version*]:
    A semantic command dispatch intended for loading external dependencies into the environment.

Example:

    use_ruby() {
      echo "Ruby $1"
    }
    use ruby 1.9.3
    # output: Ruby 1.9.3

* `use rbenv`:
    Loads rbenv which add the ruby wrappers available on the PATH.
* `rvm` ...:
    Should work just like in the shell if you have rvm installed.
