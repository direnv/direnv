============================================

NAME
----

direnv-stdlib - functions for the `.envrc`

SYNOPSIS
--------

`direnv stdlib`

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Outputs a bash script called the *stdlib*. The following commands are included in that script and loaded in the context of an `.envrc`. In addition, it also loads the file in `~/.direnvrc` if it exists.

STDLIB
------

### `has <command>`

Returns 0 if the *command* is available. Returns 1 otherwise. It can be a binary in the PATH or a shell function.

Example:

    if has curl; then
      echo "Yes we do"
    fi

### `expand_path <rel_path> [<relative_to>]`

Outputs the absolute path of *rel_path* relative to *relative_to* or the current directory.

Example:

    cd /usr/local/games
    expand_path ../foo
    # output: /usr/local/foo

### `dotenv [<dotenv_path>]`

Loads a ".env" file into the current environment

### `user_rel_path <abs_path>`

Transforms an absolute path *abs_path* into a user-relative path if possible.

Example:

    echo $HOME
    # output: /home/user
    user_rel_path /home/user/my/project
    # output: ~/my/project
    user_rel_path /usr/local/lib
    # output: /usr/local/lib

### `find_up <filename>`

Outputs the path of *filename* when searched from the current directory up to /. Returns 1 if the file has not been found.

Example:

    cd /usr/local/my
    mkdir -p project/foo
    touch bar
    cd project/foo
    find_up bar
    # output: /usr/local/my/bar

### `source_env <file_or_dir_path>`

Loads another `.envrc` either by specifying its path or filename.

NOTE: the other `.envrc` is not checked by the security framework.


### `source_hash <file_or_dir_path> <shasum>`

Loads another `.envrc` either by specifying its path or filename.

The other ".envrc" is validated using shasum check.

### `source_up [<filename>]`

Loads another `.envrc` if found when searching from the parent directory up to /.

NOTE: the other `.envrc` is not checked by the security framework.

### `direnv_apply_dump <file>`

Loads the output of `direnv dump` that was stored in a file.

### `direnv_load [<command-generating-dump-output>]`

Applies the environment generated by running *argv* as a command. This is useful for adopting the environment of a child process - cause that process to run "direnv dump" and then wrap the results with direnv_load.

Example:

    direnv_load opam-env exec -- direnv dump

### `PATH_add <path>`

Prepends the expanded *path* to the PATH environment variable. It prevents a common mistake where PATH is replaced by only the new *path*.

Example:

    pwd
    # output: /home/user/my/project
    PATH_add bin
    echo $PATH
    # output: /home/user/my/project/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

### `MANPATH_add <path>`

Prepends the expanded *path* to the MANPATH environment variable. It takes care of man-specific heuritic.

### `path_add <varname> <path>`

Works like `PATH_add` except that it's for an arbitrary *varname*.

### `load_prefix <prefix_path>`

Expands some common path variables for the given *prefix_path* prefix. This is useful if you installed something in the *prefix_path* using `./configure --prefix=$prefix_path && make install` and want to use it in the project.

Variables set:

    CPATH
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    LIBRARY_PATH
    MANPATH
    PATH
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH

Example:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/rubies/ruby-1.9.3
    make && make install
    # Then in the .envrc
    load_prefix ~/rubies/ruby-1.9.3

### `layout <type>`

A semantic dispatch used to describe common project layouts.

### `layout go`

Sets the GOPATH environment variable to the current directory.

### `layout node`

Adds "$PWD/node_modules/.bin" to the PATH environment variable.

### `layout perl`

Setup environment variables required by perl's local::lib See http://search.cpan.org/dist/local-lib/lib/local/lib.pm for more details.

### `layout python [<python_exe>]`

Creates and loads a virtualenv environment under `$PWD/.direnv/python-$python_version`. This forces the installation of any egg into the project's sub-folder.

It's possible to specify the python executable if you want to use different versions of python (eg: `layout python python3`).

Note that previously virtualenv was located under `$PWD/.direnv/virtualenv` and will be re-used by direnv if it exists.

### `layout python3`

A shortcut for `layout python python3`

### `layout ruby`

Sets the GEM_HOME environment variable to `$PWD/.direnv/ruby/RUBY_VERSION`. This forces the installation of any gems into the project's sub-folder. If you're using bundler it will create wrapper programs that can be invoked directly instead of using the `bundle exec` prefix.  

### `use <program_name> [<version>]`

A semantic command dispatch intended for loading external dependencies into the environment.

Example:

    use_ruby() {
      echo "Ruby $1"
    }
    use ruby 1.9.3
    # output: Ruby 1.9.3

### `use rbenv`

Loads rbenv which add the ruby wrappers available on the PATH.

### `use nix [...]`

Load environment variables from `nix-shell`.

If you have a `default.nix` or `shell.nix` these will be used by default, but you can also specify packages directly (e.g `use nix -p ocaml`).

See http://nixos.org/nix/manual/#sec-nix-shell

### `use guix [...]`

Load environment variables from `guix environment`.

Any arguments given will be passed to guix environment. For example, `use guix hello` would setup an environment with the dependencies of the hello package. To create an environment including hello, the `--ad-hoc` flag is used `use guix --ad-hoc hello`. Other options include `--load` which allows loading an environment from a file.

See https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/html_node/Invoking-guix-environment.html

### `rvm [...]`

Should work just like in the shell if you have rvm installed.

### `use node [<version>]`:

Loads NodeJS version from a `.node-version` or `.nvmrc` file.

If you specify a partial NodeJS version (i.e. `4.2`), a fuzzy match is performed and the highest matching version installed is selected.

Example (.envrc):

    set -e
    use node

Example (.node-version):

    4.2

### `use node <version>`

Loads specified NodeJS version.

Example (.envrc):

    set -e
    use node 4.2.2

### `watch_file <path> [<path> ...]`

Adds each file to direnv's watch-list. If the file changes direnv will reload the environment on the next prompt.

Example (.envrc):

    watch_file Gemfile

### `direnv_version <version_at_least>`

Checks that the direnv version is at least old as `version_at_least`. This can
be useful when sharing an `.envrc` and to make sure that the users are up to
date.
