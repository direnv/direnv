.SH "NAME"
\fBdirenv\fR \- Unclutter your \.profile
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBdirenv\fR \fIcommand\fR [\.\.\.]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBdirenv\fR project is a bash/zsh shell extension that allows you to load/unload environment variables depending on your path\.
.
.P
It has many uses but mine it to have project\-specific settings so as to not clutter my \fB~/\.profile\fR\. I\'m using it to specify ruby version, set AWS or SSH keys, \.\.\.
.
.P
The \fBdirenv\fR command\-line is a proxy to the sub\-commands and it work like the git(1) wrapper\. You don\'t usually use that\. Once the shell extension is loaded, most of the interaction is done in your \fB\.envrc\fR files\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.
.nf

$ cd ~/code/my_project
$ ls
bin/ lib/ Rakefile README\.md
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
$ echo PATH_add bin > \.envrc
\.envrc is not allowed
$ direnv allow
direnv: reloading
direnv: loading \.envrc
direnv export: ~PATH
$ echo $PATH
/Users/zimbatm/code/my_project/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
$ cd \.\.
direnv: unloading
direnv export: ~PATH
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
.
.fi
.
.SH "USAGE"
Place a \fB\.envrc\fR file in the folder you want and add some export(1) in it\. If you cd(1) in that directory or child, the exported variables are available\. If you cd(1) out of it, they are unloaded\.
.
.P
A range of utility functions are available in the \fB\.envrc\fR context and are documented in the direnv\-stdlib(1) page\.
.
.P
If the \fB\.envrc\fR file is added/changed/removed or you is no longer in the path, the environment is reloaded\.
.
.SH "INSTALL"
Add this line at the very end of your \.bashrc or \.zshrc:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

eval "$(direnv hook $0)"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Make sure it\'s even after rvm, git\-prompt and other shell extensions that manipulate your prompt\.
.
.SH "CONTRIBUTE"
Bug reports, contributions and forks are welcome\.
.
.P
