.SH NAME
.PP
direnv fetchurl \- Fetch a URL to disk

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fIdirenv fetchurl\fP <url> [<integrity-hash>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command downloads the given URL into a fixed disk location, based on the
content of the retrieved file.

.PP
This has been introduced to avoid a dependency on \fB\fCcurl\fR or \fB\fCwget\fR, while also
promoting a more secure way to fetch data from the Internet. Use this instead
of \fB\fCcurl <url> | sh\fR\&.

.PP
This command has two modes of operation:
.IP "  1." 5
Just pass the URL to discover the integrity hash.
.IP "  2." 5
Pass the URL \fIand\fP the integrity hash to get back the on\-disk location.

.PP
Since the on\-disk location is based on the hash, it also acts as a cache. One
implication of this design is that URLs must be stable and always return the
same content.

.PP
Downloaded files are marked as read\-only and executable so it can also be used
to fetch and execute static binaries.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
<url>
    A HTTP URL that returns content on HTTP GET requests. 301 and other
    redirects are followed.

.PP
<integrity-hash>
    When passed, the integrity of the retrieved content will be validated
    against the given hash. The hash encoding is based on the SRI W3C
    specificiation (see 
\[la]https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/\[ra] ).

.SH OUTPUT
.PP
\fIdirenv fetchurl\fP outputs different content based on the argument.

.PP
If the \fB\fCintegrity\-hash\fR is being passed, it will output the path to the
on\-disk location, if the retrieval was successful.

.PP
If only the \fB\fCurl\fR is being passed, it will output the hash as well as some
human\-readable instruction. If stdout is not a tty, only the hash will be
displayed.

.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
.RS

.nf
$ ./direnv fetchurl https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix\-2.3.7/install
Found hash: sha256\-7Gxl5GzI9juc/U30Igh/pY+p6+gj5Waohfwql3jHIds=

Invoke fetchurl again with the hash as an argument to get the disk location:

  direnv fetchurl "https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix\-2.3.7/install" "sha256\-7Gxl5GzI9juc/U30Igh/pY+p6+gj5Waohfwql3jHIds="
  #=> /home/zimbatm/.cache/direnv/cas/sha256\-7Gxl5GzI9juc\_U30Igh\_pY+p6+gj5Waohfwql3jHIds=

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
\fBXDG\_CACHE\_HOME\fP
    This variable is used to select the on\-disk location of the fetched URLs
    as \fB\fC$XDG\_CACHE\_HOME/direnv/cas\fR\&. If \fBXDG\_CACHE\_HOME\fP is unset or empty,
    defaults to \fB\fC$HOME/.cache\fR\&.
