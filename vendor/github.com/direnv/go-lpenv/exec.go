// Package exec runs external commands. It wraps os.StartProcess to make it
// easier to remap stdin and stdout, connect I/O with pipes, and do other
// adjustments.
//
// Unlike the "system" library call from C and other languages, the
// os/exec package intentionally does not invoke the system shell and
// does not expand any glob patterns or handle other expansions,
// pipelines, or redirections typically done by shells. The package
// behaves more like C's "exec" family of functions. To expand glob
// patterns, either call the shell directly, taking care to escape any
// dangerous input, or use the path/filepath package's Glob function.
// To expand environment variables, use package os's ExpandEnv.
//
// Note that the examples in this package assume a Unix system.
// They may not run on Windows, and they do not run in the Go Playground
// used by golang.org and godoc.org.
