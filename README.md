direnv -- Unclutter your .profile
=================================

`direnv` is a shell extension that loads different environment variables
depending on your path.

Instead of putting every environment variable in your "~/.profile", have
directory-specific ".envrc" files for your AWS_ACCESS_KEY, LIBRARY_PATH or
other environment variables.

It does some of the job of rvm, rbenv or virtualenv but in a
language-agnostic way.

## Example

```
$ cd ~/code/my_project
$ ls
bin/ lib/ Rakefile README.md
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
$ direnv edit .
# Opens in your `$EDITOR .envrc`. Add:
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
$
direnv: loading .envrc
direnv export: ~PATH
$ echo $PATH
/Users/zimbatm/code/my_project/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
$ cd ..
direnv: unloading
direnv export: ~PATH
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

## Install

### 1. Install the code

```bash
git clone http://github.com/zimbatm/direnv
cd direnv
make install
# or symlink bin/direnv into your $PATH
```

For Mac users, you can also use `brew install direnv`

### 2. Add the hook for your shell

This is what is going to enable the direnv extension. It's going to allow
direnv to execute before every prompt command and adjust the environment.

#### BASH

Add the following line at the end of your "~/.bashrc" file:
```bash
eval "$(direnv hook $0)"
```

Make sure it appears even after rvm, git-prompt and other shell extensions
that manipulate your prompt.

#### ZSH

Add the following line at the end of you "~/.zshrc" file:

```zsh
eval "$(direnv hook $0)"
```

If you want to place it in another file replace $0 with "zsh" as zsh changes
the value dynamically.

#### FISH

Add the following line at the end of your "~/.config/fish/config.fish" file:

```fish
eval (direnv hook fish)
```

## Usage

Use `direnv edit .` to open an ".envrc" in your $EDITOR. This script is going
to be executed once you exit the editor. Every `export` is going to be
available in your shell until you `cd ..` out of the directory.

To make your life convenient there is a couple of additional commands in the
.envrc execution context that are loaded from the `direnv stdlib`.
