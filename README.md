direnv - Unclutter your .profile
================================

direnv is a small POSIX utility that works in combination with your shell (bash or zsh).
It allows you to have path-dependent environment variables, and load/unload them
when navigating through your filesystem.

Usage
-----

Usually, I set an .envrc file in projects that have a bin/ or lib/ directory.

When navigating a project's root directory (or sub-directories), direnv will
add the bin/ directory to my path and the lib/ directory to the target-language's libpath.
That way they are handily available, no need to set something by hand.

I also use direnv to set the GEM_HOME environment variable to make project-dependent gemsets.
The gemset moves with the project unlike in rvm. Feature request: the cache directory could
be set to $HOME/.gem/cache, it would really help.

Install
-------

1) Get the code

  git clone http://github.com/zimbatm/shell-env

2) Put `direnv` in your PATH

For example by symlinking it in your ~/bin or /usr/local/bin directory

3) Add this line to your .bashrc:

    eval `direnv hook bash`

zsh users can use the same code and forget the last line, precmd is a magic function. (TO BE TESTED, please report)
