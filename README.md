direnv -- Unclutter your .profile
=================================

`direnv` is an environment switcher for the shell. It knows how to hook into
bash, zsh, tcsh and fish shell to load or unload environment variables
depending on the current directory. This allows project-specific
environment variables without cluttering the "~/.profile" file.

Before each prompt, direnv checks for the existence of a ".envrc" file in the
current and parent directories. If the file exists (and is authorized), it is
loaded into a **bash** sub-shell and all exported variables are then captured by
direnv and then made available to the current shell.

Because direnv is compiled into a single static executable, it is fast enough
to be unnoticeable on each prompt. It is also language-agnostic and can be
used to build solutions similar to rbenv, pyenv and phpenv.


## Example

```
$ cd ~/my_project
$ echo ${FOO-nope}
nope
$ echo export FOO=foo > .envrc
.envrc is not allowed
$ direnv allow .
direnv: reloading
direnv: loading .envrc
direnv export: +FOO
$ echo ${FOO-nope}
foo
$ cd ..
direnv: unloading
direnv export: ~PATH
$ echo ${FOO-nope}
nope
```

## Install

### From source

Dependencies: make, golang

```bash
git clone https://github.com/direnv/direnv
cd direnv
make install
# or symlink ./direnv into the $PATH
```

### From system packages

direnv is packaged for a variety of systems:

* [Fedora](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/direnv)
* [Arch AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/direnv/)
* [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=direnv&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all)
* [Gentoo go-overlay](https://github.com/Dr-Terrible/go-overlay)
* [NetBSD pkgsrc-wip](http://www.pkgsrc.org/wip/)
* [NixOS](https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html)
* [OSX Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
* [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=direnv&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all)
* [GNU Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/)

### From binary builds

Binary builds for a variety of architectures are also available for
[each release](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/releases).

Fetch the binary, `chmod +x direnv` and put it somewhere in your PATH.

## Setup

For direnv to work properly it needs to be hooked into the shell. Each shell
has its own extension mechanism:

### BASH

Add the following line at the end of the "~/.bashrc" file:

```sh
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"
```

Make sure it appears even after rvm, git-prompt and other shell extensions
that manipulate the prompt.

### ZSH

Add the following line at the end of the "~/.zshrc" file:

```sh
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
```

### FISH

Add the following line at the end of the "~/.config/fish/config.fish" file:

```fish
eval (direnv hook fish)
```

### TCSH

Add the following line at the end of the "~/.cshrc" file:

```sh
eval `direnv hook tcsh`
```


## Usage

In some target folder, create a ".envrc" file and add some export(1)
directives in it.

Note that the contents of the `.envrc` file must be valid bash syntax,
regardless of the shell you are using.
This is because direnv always executes the `.envrc` with bash (a sort of
lowest common denominator of UNIX shells) so that direnv can work across shells.
If you try to use some syntax that doesn't work in bash (like zsh's
nested expansions), you will [run into
trouble](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/issues/199).

On the next prompt you will notice that direnv complains about the ".envrc"
being blocked. This is the security mechanism to avoid loading new files
automatically. Otherwise any git repo that you pull, or tar archive that you
unpack, would be able to wipe your hard drive once you `cd` into it.

So here we are pretty sure that it won't do anything bad. Type `direnv allow .`
and watch direnv loading your new environment. Note that `direnv edit .` is a
handy shortcut that opens the file in your $EDITOR and automatically allows it
if the file's modification time has changed.

Now that the environment is loaded, you will notice that once you `cd` out
of the directory it automatically gets unloaded. If you `cd` back into it, it's
loaded again. That's the basis of the mechanism that allows you to build cool
things.

### The stdlib

Exporting variables by hand is a bit repetitive so direnv provides a set of
utility functions that are made available in the context of the ".envrc" file.

As an example, the `PATH_add` function is used to expand and prepend a path to
the $PATH environment variable. Instead of `export $PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH` you
can write `PATH_add bin`. It's shorter and avoids a common mistake where
`$PATH=bin`.

To find the documentation for all available functions check the
direnv-stdlib(1) man page.

It's also possible to create your own extensions by creating a bash file at
"~/.config/direnv/direnvrc" or "~/.direnvrc". This file is loaded before your
".envrc" and thus allows you to make your own extensions to direnv.

#### Loading layered .envrc

Let's say you have the following structure:

- "/a/.envrc"
- "/a/b/.envrc"

If you add the following line in "/a/b/.envrc", you can load both of the
".envrc" files when you are in `/a/b`:

```sh
source_env ..
```
